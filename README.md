# Learning python: recipe APIs

A Django project created following the Udemy course "[Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/)".

The course used TDD to create various REST APIs, using Docker, Django, and Postgres. 

The completed project was deployed to AWS (EC2). The Swagger API docs for some of the endpoints can be seen in this screenshot:
